Python Library for displaying Messages via libnotify

DESCRIPTION:
This is a python library for displaying notifications. The name may be a little bit irritating.
The aim was to create a server-client model for displaying such notifications. Furthermore
appending and updating of notifications should be possible and the usage should be very easy.
Therefor a server site and a client site was developed. The server manages the registering of
clients as well as the receiving and displaying of the notifications. The client just establishes
a connection to the server and transmits the messages which should be displayed. The communication
between client and server is done via DBus and the notifications are displayed with the held of
the pynotify package.

USAGE:
For displaying messages both, a server and a client must be started. The server can be started
as a system daemon. This isn't implemented, but should be very easy. An other library can be used
for creating a daemon. After this is done properly the run method of the server must be called.
This will start an eventloop listening for DBus activity. The client side is easy to use to. Just
inherit from the client, or get an instance. (Note to call the __init__ method of the client class
if you want to use inheritance, because the connection to the server is established there.). After
this is done, messaged easily can be send with the send_message method. (See documentation for more
information.)

LICENSE:
The library is licensed with the GPLv2.
